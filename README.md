# FSAB Bootcamp 24 Deliverable 

I made a notebook app. It shows old notes and has a form to create new forms.
React was used for frontend and Firebase was used for backend.
I made both frontend and backend in the same folder. 
To run it, just create two terminals and use one to run "node ." and the other to run "npm start dev"
